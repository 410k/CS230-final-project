A cute multi-layer LSTM network that can perform like a human ðŸŽ¶ It learns the dynamics of music!  If you wish to learn more about my finding, then please read my [blogpost](http://imanmalik.com/cs/2017/06/05/neural-style.html). The architecture was specifically designed to handle music of different genres.
